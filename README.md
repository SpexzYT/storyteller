Storyteller is a Discord bot coded in JavaScript with
[discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) using the
[Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando) command framework
for Discord's 2019 Hack Week. His main feature is the ability to play
the classic circle game Mafia, using a voice channel for the players
to interact alongside a fully-voiced storyteller, creating one of the
most immersive Discord bot games in existence.

## Licensing

The bot is licensed under the GPL 3.0 license. See the file `LICENSE` for more
information. If you plan to use any part of this source code in your own bot, I
would be grateful if you would include some form of credit somewhere.
